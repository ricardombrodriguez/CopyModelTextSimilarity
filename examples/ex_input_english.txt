God save our gracious King/Queen,
Long live our noble King/Queen,
God save the King/Queen!
Send her/him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the King/Queen!

O Lord our God arise,
Scatter our enemies,
And make them fall!
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all!

Not in this land alone,
But be God’s mercies known,
From shore to shore!
Lord make the nations see,
That men should brothers be,
And form one family,
The wide world o’er.

From every latent foe,
From the assassins blow,
God save the Queen/King!
O’er her/his thine arm extend,
For Britain’s sake defend,
Our mother/father, prince, and friend,
God save the King/Queen!

Thy choicest gifts in store,
On her be pleased to pour,
Long may she/he reign!
May she/he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the King/Queen!
